I am an audio engineer and a web developer in training. I am currently attending Northwestern University's Full Stack Bootcamp to gain skills as a web developer. In 2019, I graduated from Millikin University with a degree in Commercial Music. I am an avid football fan, I like 72Â° days with a light breeze, and enjoy walking aimlessly throughout Chicago.
