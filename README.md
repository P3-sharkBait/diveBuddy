## Our Pitch
```
Dive Buddy is an application that calculates different stats for divers, a convenient alternative to filling out paper forms. On this application a user can create an account, review and update their dashboard, and view a feed that includes other registered users. 

Once a diver has created an account they can start filling dive logs. All of their completed dive logs can then be found under the “dashboard” feature of the application. The dive log presents the user with the needed fields for the app to calculate pressure used, pressure at depth, total nitrogen time, ending letter group, next residual nitrogen, next start letter, next max diving time, etc. 

Our application can also be used as a dedicated social media platform for divers. People who dive with friends and family can add each other as “dive buddies”. When a diver creates an account they are given an ID number. Users can add friends by exchanging these IDs. All the users they add are then displayed on their personalized “feed” page.

Finally, as a way to promote education and encourage new divers, we've included a Stripe link to donate to the "Diving with a Purpose" nonprofit.  Such donations are optional, of course.

Are you ready to dive in?
```

**Concept:** A hybrid recordkeeping and social media platform specifically tailored to divers.

## User Stories

### Gurgle
```
I'm still learning to dive, and safety is very important to me. As a user, I want to be able to enter my dive information and quickly and accurately generate figures like how long I should stay out of the water between dives and what my next safest maximum depth could be. I also want to be able to refer back to previous entries to see my progress since I started.
```

### Deb and Flo
```
We'll use the dive log too, but for us diving is about being with friends and seeing photos from their latest dives. We want a way to meet other divers, share our photos, and find new and interesting places we might like to try.
```

### Gill
```
I'm a serious diver, it's one of my passions, so in addition to those features I would like a way to give back to the hobby as a whole. When I go to log my dives or connect with friends, I'd also like a way to donate to a diving-related non-profit that supports education and inclusion for anyone who might still be getting started.
```

## A Sample Walkthrough

Here are the steps a user would take when trying our application for the first time:

```
First you're going to register a unique username and password and sign in
This will take you to your dashboard and generate a unique user ID that you will be able to exchange with other users to expand your feed
When you create and complete a new card, that data is integrated into your existing logs
Some of the entry is manual, but the rest is calculated from those figures on your behalf
If you navigate over to the feed, you will see similar information from other users whose IDs you've added
You also have the option to delete your existing account if you decide to do so
```
