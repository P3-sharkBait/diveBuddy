# User Story
Dive Buddy is an application that calculates dive stats for divers, a pose to having to fill out a paper form. On this application a user can create an account, view their dashboard, and view a feed. 

Once a diver has created an account they can start creating dive forms. All of their completed dive logs can be found under the “dashboard” feature of the application. The dive log presents the user with the needed fields for the app to calculate pressure used, pressure at depth, total nitrogen time, ending letter group, next residual nitrogen, next start letter, next max diving time, ect. 

Our application can also be used as social media. People that choose to dive with friends and family can add each other as “dive buddies”. When a diver creates an account they are given an ID number. A user can add friends using the ID number feature. All the users added are displayed on the “feed” page.
